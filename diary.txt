Strategy:

Overall: Recreate my full-stack web app from Hackbright and make it fit the requirements of the take-home.
- Set up a virtual environment (done 2/15/2022)
- Install Flask in virtual environment (pip3 install flask - done 2/5/2022)
- Make gitignore (done)
- Make a Flask app at server.py
    - Set up the skeleton
    - Install dependencies (in progress)
- Figure out the routes?
- Figure out the data model? Do I need a database?
- Do I need sessions? 
- Do I need a front end?
